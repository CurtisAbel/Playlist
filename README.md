# Playlist
 Created an application using ArrayLists and LinkedLists. Users can add songs from different albums(ArrayLists) to their playlist(LinkedList). Users are able to go forwards, go backwards or play the current song again through the LinkedList. Implemented a loop feature. If loop mode on, it will continue to the song at the top of the linklist. Can also go back from the head to the tail of the linkedlist when in loop mode. Users can also put put their playlist on shuffle.
